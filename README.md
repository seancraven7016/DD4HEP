# summer-student

This is a repository of Gabriel Penn's summer 2016 work on adapting existing work on SiD for use with the DD4hep toolkit. Please feel free to direct any queries to gp13181@bristol.ac.uk.

# Directories:
 - init: initialisation scripts for environment setup
 - compact: detector descriptions (adapted from the SiD description included with lcgeo)
 - particlegun: particle gun scripts for ddsim and the LCIO particle input files they generate
 - reco: reconstruction steering files for Marlin
 - analysis: pyLCIO analysis scripts, adapted from Josh Tingey's pixel studies (see pixelStudies repo)
 - auto: miscellaneous shell scripts for submitting multiple jobs

# Getting started
These instructions assume you are SSHing to a UoB SL6 machine (e.g. Soolin) with access to cvmfs. ILCSoft libraries are available on cvmfs, so you will not need to install DD4hep, LCIO, Marlin etc locally.

These instructions are based on [those provided by Dr Aidan Robson (Glasgow)](https://twiki.ppe.gla.ac.uk/bin/view/LinearCollider/GlaSiDGettingStarted), which you may find to be more up-to-date but less tailored to our setups.

## Installing lcgeo
Start by setting up your environment:
```
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/releases/gcc/4.8.4/x86_64-slc6/setup.sh
source /cvmfs/ilc.desy.de/sw/x86_64_gcc48_sl6/v01-17-09/init_ilcsoft.sh
```

Navigate to the directory in which you wish to install lcgeo (I recommend your home directory) and checkout the source code:
```
cd ~
svn co https://svnsrv.desy.de/basic/ddsim/lcgeo/trunk lcgeo
```
Remove some unfinished(?) calorimeter files:
```
rm lcgeo/detector/calorimeter/SHcal*
rm lcgeo/detector/calorimeter/SEcal*
rm lcgeo/detector/CaloTB/CaloPrototype*
```
Create the build directory and move to it:
```
mkdir build
cd build
```
Make the installation:
```
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=`which g++` -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=`which gcc` -C /cvmfs/ilc.desy.de/sw/x86_64_gcc48_sl6/ILCSoft.cmake ..
make -j4
make install
```
If this runs without throwing any errors, you should now be able to run the example simulation.
## Running an example sim
In a clean login shell, navigate to your lcgeo directory and initialise your environment (see below):
```
cd ~/lcgeo
source __path to your local copy of this repository__/summer-student/init/init_master.sh
```
Run the example particle gun script:
```
python example/lcio_particle_gun.py
```
Run the simulation with the default geometry and the example input particles you have just generated:
```
ddsim --compactFile=SiD/compact/SiD_o1_v01/SiD_o1_v01.xml --runType=batch --inputFile mcparticles.slcio -N=1 --outputFile=testSiD_o1_v01.slcio
```
If this has worked, you will now have a file named testSiD_o1_v01.slcio. You can find out what data this output file contains in summary:
```
anajob testSiD_o1_v01.slcio
```
or in full detail:
```
dumpevent testSiD_o1_v01.slcio 1
```
You should now be ready to try running a reconstruction.

## Running an example reconstruction

Now navigate into your local summer-student repository and find SiDReconstruction_test160628.xml. You will need to edit this file so that the relevant file paths are correct for your local files. The LCIO input file is the 'testSiD_o1_v01.slcio' you just generated. For the compact files, you can use either those in lcgeo/SiD or in summer-student/compact. You can then run the reconstruction:
```
Marlin SiDReconstruction_test160628.xml
```
(Don't worry about the ECal errors: this part of the reconstruction is still under development.)

You should now have a file named 'sitracks.slcio' that you can run anajob on (as above) to check its contents.

# Running the chain

Here are some general instructions for running the simulatiom->reconstruction->analysis chain. First off, you will need to set up your environment: I have provided a master initialisation script for this purpose, init/init_master_new.sh.

## Generating input particles

For simple input events (e.g. test muons), modify a copy of lcio_particle_gun.py to generate the desired particles. It should be fairly straightforward to figure out how to change the particle type, momentum, angular distribution etc. You may wish to store your particle gun scripts and lcio files in summer-student/particles.
